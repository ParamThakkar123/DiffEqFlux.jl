# Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) with TensorLayer

In this tutorial, we show how to use the `DiffEqFlux` TensorLayer to solve problems
in Physics Informed Machine Learning.

Let's consider the anharmonic oscillator described by the ODE

```math
ẍ = - kx - αx³ - βẋ -γẋ³.
```

We first transform this second order differential equation into a system of first order
differential equations for use in `DiffEqFlux`: We let `ẋ = v` then

```math
ẋ = v \\
v̇ = - kx - αx³ - βv̇ -γv̇³.
```

To obtain the training data, we solve the equation of motion using one of the
solvers in `DifferentialEquations`:

```@example tensor
using ComponentArrays, DiffEqFlux, Optimization, OptimizationOptimisers, OrdinaryDiffEq,
      LinearAlgebra, Random
k, α, β, γ = 1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3
tspan = (0.0, 10.0)

function dxdt_train(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = -k * u[1] - α * u[1]^3 - β * u[2] - γ * u[2]^3
end

u0 = [1.0, 0.0]
ts = collect(0.0:0.1:tspan[2])
prob_train = ODEProblem{true}(dxdt_train, u0, tspan)
data_train = Array(solve(prob_train, Tsit5(); saveat = ts))
```

Now, we create a TensorLayer that will be able to perform 10th order expansions in
a Legendre Basis:

```@example tensor
A = [Basis.Legendre(10), Basis.Legendre(10)]
nn = Layers.TensorProductLayer(A, 1)
ps, st = Lux.setup(Xoshiro(0), nn)
ps = ComponentArray(ps)
nn = StatefulLuxLayer{true}(nn, nothing, st)
```

and we also instantiate the model we are trying to learn, “informing” the neural
about the `∝x` and `∝v` dependencies in the equation of motion:

```@example tensor
f = x -> min(30one(x), x)

function dxdt_pred(du, u, p, t)
    du[1] = u[2]
    du[2] = -p.p_model[1] * u[1] - p.p_model[2] * u[2] + f(nn(u, p.ps)[1])
end

p_model = zeros(2)
α = ComponentArray(; p_model, ps = ps .* 0)

prob_pred = ODEProblem{true}(dxdt_pred, u0, tspan, α)
```

Note that we introduced a “cap” in the neural network term to avoid instabilities
in the solution of the ODE. We also initialized the vector of parameters to zero
in order to obtain a faster convergence for this particular example.

Finally, we introduce the corresponding loss function:

```@example tensor
function predict_adjoint(θ)
    x = Array(solve(prob_pred, Tsit5(); p = θ, saveat = ts,
        sensealg = InterpolatingAdjoint(; autojacvec = ReverseDiffVJP(true))))
end

function loss_adjoint(θ)
    x = predict_adjoint(θ)
    loss = sum(norm.(x - data_train))
    return loss
end

iter = 0
function callback(θ, l)
    global iter
    iter += 1
    if iter % 10 == 0
        println(l)
    end
    return false
end
```

and we train the network using two rounds of `Adam`:

```@example tensor
adtype = Optimization.AutoZygote()
optf = Optimization.OptimizationFunction((x, p) -> loss_adjoint(x), adtype)
optprob = Optimization.OptimizationProblem(optf, α)
res1 = Optimization.solve(
    optprob, OptimizationOptimisers.Adam(0.05); callback = callback, maxiters = 150)

optprob2 = Optimization.OptimizationProblem(optf, res1.u)
res2 = Optimization.solve(
    optprob2, OptimizationOptimisers.Adam(0.001); callback = callback, maxiters = 150)
opt = res2.u
```

We plot the results, and we obtain a fairly accurate learned model:

```@example tensor
using Plots
data_pred = predict_adjoint(res1.u)
plot(ts, data_train[1, :]; label = "X (ODE)")
plot!(ts, data_train[2, :]; label = "V (ODE)")
plot!(ts, data_pred[1, :]; label = "X (NN)")
plot!(ts, data_pred[2, :]; label = "V (NN)")
```
